# AEM Component Complexity Rules

## üö® MANDATORY: Rule File Behavior - NO EXCEPTIONS (AI Reference Only)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: ALWAYS read this rule file first before analyzing component complexity:**
1. **üö® MANDATORY: ALWAYS read the rule file first** - **NO EXCEPTIONS**
2. **üö® MANDATORY: Follow complexity rules exactly** - **NO MODIFICATIONS**
3. **üö® MANDATORY: Apply appropriate complexity level** - **NO SKIPPING**
4. **üö® MANDATORY: Create context files when needed** - **NO IGNORING**

## üö® ANTI-MISBEHAVIOR RULES
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: NEVER do these things:**
1. **NEVER ask for information not specified in this rule file**
2. **NEVER assume what the user wants**
3. **NEVER skip reading rule files**
4. **NEVER deviate from the exact process specified**
5. **NEVER add your own interpretation of what should happen next**
6. **NEVER ask for complexity details before following the exact process in this file**
7. **NEVER bypass the user interface flow specified in this file**

When analyzing Figma designs, HTML structures, or requirements:

## Simple Components
- Purely presentational, minimal fields (text, image, button).
- No dynamic data, API calls, or complex authoring.
- Examples: Text, Image, Button, Banner.

## Medium Complexity Components
- Multiple configurable fields, often with repeatable structures.
- Requires Sling Model with light logic.
- Dialogs may include tabs or multifields.
- Examples: Teaser, Carousel, Accordion, Card Grid.

## High Complexity Components
- Aggregate or query dynamic data.
- Include **search, filtering, ordering, pagination**, or **external API integrations**.
- Require Sling Models + OSGi services + clientlibs.
- Must always be flagged for **architect review**.
- Must be reviewed for **performance, caching, and scalability** in AEMaaCS.
- Author dialogs should support filter configuration, result size, and sort options when applicable.
- Examples: Product Listing, Search Component, Location Finder, Multi-step Form.

‚ö†Ô∏è Even if a component looks visually simple, if it involves search, filtering, ordering, or pagination, Cursor must treat it as High Complexity.
